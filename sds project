## Exploring the Data

# 1. Age
ggplot(Gestation_edits, aes(x = age, y = gestation)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Maternal Age vs Gestation Period",
    x = "Maternal Age (years)",
    y = "Gestation period (days)"
  ) +
  theme_classic(
  )

# 2. Birth weight 
ggplot(Gestation_edits, aes(x = wt, y = gestation)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Birth Weight vs. Gestation Period",
    x = "Birth Weight (oz)",
    y = "Gestation Period (days)"
  ) +
  theme_classic(
  )

# 3. Smoking
ggplot(Gestation_edits, aes(x = smoke, y = gestation)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Smoking Status vs. Gestation Period",
    x = "Smoking Status",
    y = "Gestation period (days)"
  ) +
  theme_classic(
  )

# 4. Parity
ggplot(Gestation_edits, aes(x = parity, y = gestation)) + geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Parity Status vs. Gestation Period",
    x = "Parity Status",
    y = "Gestation period (days)"
  )

# 5. Paternal Height
ggplot(Gestation_edits, aes(x = dht, y = gestation)) + geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Paternal Height vs. Gestation Period",
    x = "Paternal Height",
    y = "Gestation period (days)"

Multiple Linear Regression Model

{r}
gestation_lm <- lm(gestation ~ wt + smoke + age + parity + dht, data = Gestation_edits)
summary(gestation_lm)

Improving the Model 

{r}
# Diagnostic plots
autoplot(gestation_lm)

# Log transformations
gestation_log_lm <- lm(log(gestation) ~ log(wt) + smoke + log(age) + parity + log(dht), data = Gestation_edits)
autoplot(gestation_log_lm)

# Spline transformation
gestation_log_bs_lm <- lm(log(gestation) ~ bs(log(wt), df = 4) + smoke + bs(log(age), df = 4) + parity + bs(log(dht), df = 4), data = Gestation_edits)
autoplot(gestation_log_bs_lm)

# Interaction
gestation_log_bs_interaction_lm <- lm(log(gestation) ~ bs(log(wt), df = 4) * smoke + bs(log(age), df = 4) + parity + bs(log(dht), df = 4), data = Gestation_edits)
summary(gestation_log_bs_interaction_lm)

Formal Hypothesis Tests 

{r}
hypotheses <- lm(log(gestation) ~ bs(log(wt), df = 4) + smoke + bs(log(age), df = 4), data = Gestation_edits)
anova(hypotheses)
